### A single command deploy!

Run this in your app's directory and follow the instructions:

```bash
npx remake deploy
```

ðŸ¥³ **Now you have a public web app you can share with friends!**

**Note:** You need to purchase a paid Remake account in order to use the deploy command, but you can always [deploy Remake on your own server](/hosting/).

For following this Remake tutorial to the end, I'd like to offer you a special 20% discount on the [Remake Founder's plan](https://remaketheweb.com/#founders-deal). Just use the code **REMAKE20**! (Founder's Plan will be discontinued after 2021).
