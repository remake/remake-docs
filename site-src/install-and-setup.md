### Install & Setup


**⚡️ 1. Generate a Remake project**

You'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) first. Then use the following command to generate your first Remake app:

```bash
npx remake create my-app
```

<img src="/static/images/example-apps.png">

<p>You'll be able to choose between:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The default app <span style="opacity: .5;">(blank)</span></li>
  <li>The kanban starter app</li>
  <li>The reading list sharing app</li>
  <li>The resume/cv builder app</li>
</ul>


**🚀 2. Start the local server**

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

**📺 3. View your Remake app**

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the example app.

**🎨 4. Make your own app**

All of the code for your Remake app is in the `app/` directory.

Learn how to create an app from [the step-by-step tutorial](https://docs.remaketheweb.com/introducing-remake/).

**🌏 5. Deploy your first Remake app!**

```bash
npx remake deploy
```

Now anyone will be able to sign up for an account and use your app!
