## Build full-stack web apps with only HTML and CSS

Remake lets you convert an HTML and CSS design into a fully-functional web app with a few custom attributes.

* Simple syntax
* User accounts & persistent data
* Inline editing & file uploads
* No backend coding

If you're a designers or front-end developer who wants to build web apps, Remake was made for you.

**UPDATE 🎉:** Remake v2.0 is out and the docs are up-to-date!

### Why Remake

> What if every HTML webpage knew how to save, edit, and add new items to itself?

Have you ever created a static website and wished people could just start using it? Remake lets you do that.

* **Build full-stack apps with front-end code.** Remake comes with user accounts, a persistent database, and everything you need to deploy a working application.
* **Add CMS-like features on top of static templates.** Users can login to your site and edit their own copy of it.
* **So easy to use it feels like prototyping.** But it's designed for building scalable, production web apps.
* **You keep control over your design.** You can use any CSS framework and style your pages however you want.
* **Server rendered, secure, and fast.** This makes it ideal for SEO and loading pages quickly. The front-end framework isn't even loaded if a user can't edit the current page.



### How it works

**Creating web applications is hard.** You need to install packages, configure your build process, create API endpoints, set up a database, and load in some demo data, *and that's all before even getting started!*

**It can be easier!**

Remake makes it possible to build a web app entirely in your front-end code.

It does this by basically converting your page into a database, so when you move elements around on the page, their data is also moved!

Remake also comes with a built in inline edit popover for editing data at the click of a button.

This makes it possible to handle a lot of complicated CRUD operations automatically by adding a single data-* attribute:

* Attaching data to elements
* Editing & removing data from the page
* Moving data around the page
* Rendering new data into the page

And there's much more!

### Roadmap

In the near future, Remake will also have support for:

* Automatic form handling
* Image cropping and manipulation
* Sharing data between users
* Real-time updates
