## Build full-stack web apps with HTML

With Remake, you can create a fully-functioning web app by adding a few custom attributes to your HTML & CSS.

* Simple HTML-based syntax
* No backend coding required
* User accounts & Persistent data
* Inline editing & File uploads

Are you a designers or front-end developer?

‚ú® **Remake was made for you.** ‚ú®

### Why Remake

**Creating web applications is hard.** There's hundreds of hours of configuration, connecting components, and learning before you can even get started...

**Remake lets you skip the hard parts!**

Other frameworks make you set everything up &mdash; pages, components, database, ORM, models, state management, validation, API endpoints, user accounts, etc.

Remake skips the hard parts and gives you a small layer of data on top of your HTML that's automatically synced with each user's data.

It makes creating scalable multi-page web apps with unique data for each user incredibly easy.

### What Remake Offers

> What if every HTML webpage knew how to save, edit, and add new items to itself?

* **Build full-stack apps with front-end code.** Remake comes with user accounts, a persistent database, and everything you need to deploy a working application.
* **Add CMS-like features on top of static templates.** Users can login to your site and edit their own copy of it.
* **So easy to use it feels like prototyping.** But it's designed for building scalable, production web apps.
* **You keep control over your design.** You can use any CSS framework and style your pages however you want.
* **Server rendered, secure, and fast.** This makes it ideal for SEO and loading pages quickly. The front-end framework isn't even loaded if a user can't edit the current page.

Have you ever created a static website and wished people could just start using it? üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Remake lets you do that.** ü¶Ñ

### How It Works

<img src="/static/remake-how-it-works.png">

1. You create a nice interface with HTML & CSS
2. Remake makes your interface editable (and comes with auth baked in)
3. Each logged-in user gets their own copy of the editable interface

Remake puts your database on the front-end and treats HTML as your app's source of truth. This means when a user modifies the page by dragging something around or editing text, they're editing the database.

### Remake's Origin Story

<div style="max-width: 120px; margin-right: 2rem;"><img src="/static/images/me-circle-small.png"></div>
<p>Hi, I'm David!</p>
<p>I'm a UX designer &amp; full-stack web dev who's constantly making new products.</p>
<p>In 2019 I started getting tired of my projects taking me 14+ months to release. I wanted everyone to be able to release beautiful products in under a month.</p>
<p>I built Remake so you can spend more time:</p>
<div>
  <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">ü§© Marketing &amp; talking to users!</div>
  <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">üë©‚Äçüíª Experimenting with new ideas!</div>
  <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Building a profitable business!</div>
</div>
<p>And less time configuring your web app stack.</p>
